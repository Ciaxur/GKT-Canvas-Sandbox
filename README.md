# GKT-Canvas-Sandbox
Simple and easy to use Canvas Sandbox in GTK for Drawing.


## Introduction
This project is simply a wrapper around the `GTKMM` Library. I will be working on a Linux x64 Architectures, so most of the features are not guaranteed to work on other architectures. I will be testing other Architectures later on in project. This is still in `Early Stages` so expect more Features as the project progresses 😊. Be sure to report any bugs you encounter! 🐞
